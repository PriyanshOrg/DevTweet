HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is the standard language used to create and design websites and web pages. It provides the basic structure and content of a web page. HTML uses a system of tags to define the various elements on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.

Here's a simple example of an HTML page:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple example of an HTML page.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>
</body>
</html>
```

This simple HTML code creates a basic web page with a heading, a paragraph, and a link. When viewed in a web browser, it will display the content as described in the HTML elements.
