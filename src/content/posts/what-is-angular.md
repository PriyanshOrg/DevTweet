# What is Angular?

Angular is a popular web development platform developed and maintained by Google. It allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications using a component-based architecture. Angular is based on TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds features like static typing, generics, and decorators. It also provides a rich set of libraries that cover various aspects of web development, such as routing, forms, HTTP requests, testing, animations, and more. Angular is designed to be modular, scalable, and testable, making it suitable for large and complex applications.

# Why use Angular?

Angular has many advantages over other web frameworks, such as:

- Angular is supported by Google and a large community of developers, who contribute to its development and maintenance.
- Angular uses TypeScript, which helps to catch errors at compile time and improve code quality and readability.
- Angular has a powerful change detection mechanism that automatically updates the view when the data changes, without the need for manual DOM manipulation.
- Angular has a declarative template syntax that makes it easy to define the UI layout and logic.
- Angular has a dependency injection system that simplifies the creation and reuse of services and components.
- Angular has a built-in router that enables navigation between different views and supports lazy loading, guards, and resolvers.
- Angular has a comprehensive testing framework that supports unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

# How to get started with Angular?

To get started with Angular, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, you can use the **Angular CLI** (Command Line Interface) to create and run an Angular project. The Angular CLI is a tool that helps you to scaffold, build, test, and deploy your Angular applications.

> ### How to install Angular CLI?

To install the Angular CLI globally, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli
```

To create a new Angular project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
    ng new my-app
```

This will prompt you to answer some questions about your project configuration, such as:

1. the name of the project
1. the style sheet format i.e css, scss etc
1. and the routing option.

After that, the Angular CLI will generate the files and folders for your project and install the dependencies.

> ### How to run an Angular project?

To run your Angular project locally, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
    ng serve
```

This will compile your project and start a development server. You can then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to see your app in action.

# Conclusion

Angular is a modern web development platform that offers many benefits for building web applications. Angular uses TypeScript as its main language and follows a component-based architecture. To learn more about Angular, you can visit its official website1 or read its documentation2. You can also check out some examples of Angular applications on its showcase page.
